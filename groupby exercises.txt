Exercises on GroupBy
====================

Please find below Big Mart Sales dataset. Read this dataset
in Pandas and answer the following seven simple questions:

1. Group the dataset based on the Outlet_Location_Type using GroupBy
    and count of different outlet location types.

2. Use agg() function on these groups and perform several statistical
   computations (mean, std, var etc) on all data at once!

3. Group data by 'Outlet_Location_Type' and 'Outlet_Establishment_Year'
   and summarise Item_Outlet_Sales by mean and std

4. Get mean Item MRPs by Item_Fat_Content

5. Get average sales by Outlet_Establishment_year.

6. Get average item_visibility and total outlet sales by outlet_type and outlet_location_type

7. For whole dataframe, find average visibility.
