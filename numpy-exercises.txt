Perform the following numpy exercises. You may use ipython IDE
for the purpose. Write your answers after each question
creating space as needed. Submit your results on Moodle.

1.   Create a numpy array from the following list of numbers:
	     [2,7,2,90]

2.  Create a numpy array from the following list of lists:
	     [[2,7,2,90] , [23,4,56,7,65,34]]

3.  Create a numpy array from following tuple:
	     (4,7,12,90,34)

4.  Create a numpy array from keys of following dictionary:
	     t = {'a' : 23, 'b' :78}

5.  Create a numpy array of random numbers with shape (6,10)
	  Name this array, say 'abc'

6. In the array of problem (v), determine:

	a. Its shape
	b. Its dimensions
	c. Its data-type (dtype)
	d. Its maximum element value
	e. Its minimum element value
	f. Divide every element of array by 10
	g. Slice the array from 2nd column to 5th
	h. Slice the array from 2nd column to 5th and
	   from 3rd row to 5th row.
	i. Round every value in the array to two decimal points
	j. Create another random array of shape(6,10) and add
	   the two arrays
	k. Reshape the array to shape (3,20)
	l. Can you reshape the array of (3,19)? If not why not?
	m) Extract from array 2nd, 4th and 5th columns
	n) Extract from array 2nd, 4th and 5th rows
	n) Calculate row-wise mean
	o) Calculate column-wise median
	p) Calculate mean of all values
	q) Assign a constant value of 8
	   to all elements in column 6
	   and rows 4 and 5.
	r) Alter arrays datatype (dtype) to float32

7. Create a numpy array of shape (2,4) full of zeros
8. Create a numpy array of shape (2,4) full of 1s
9. Transpose array ('abc' ) created in problem (5)
10.  Create two arrays from the following two-lists:

		list1:  [2,3,6,7,8]
		list2:  [3,3,5,7,7]

    Check in the two arrays which elements are equal.

11. Create a numpy array from the following list:
	  	[[2,3,np.nan,4,5,6], [7,8,9,np.nan,10,11], [np.nan, np.nan,np.nan, 3,4,5]]

    Then check how many elements are nan or NULL. (hint: use np.isnan(), np.sum())

12. Create an array from following list and check which elements are equal to 0
				list1:  [0,0,4,0,9,8]              (hint: use np.where() or np.nonzero())

13. Normalize the numpy array with maximum of respective column:
        np.array([[2,4,10], [20,400,800]])


14. How to get the positions where elements of arrays, a and b match?

			a = np.array([[1,2,3], [3,4,5]])
			b = np.array([[10,2,30],[3,40,5]])

15 Extract all numbers between 6.0 to 6.6 from below numpy array?

			z = np.random.normal(loc = 5.7, scale = 3, size = (6,3))


16. Swap two columns of numpy array (z) in the above problem

17. Swap two rows of numpy array (z) in the problem 15.

18. Create a 2D array containing random floats between 5 and 10?

19. Print only 3 decimal places in python numpy array z of problem 15.
