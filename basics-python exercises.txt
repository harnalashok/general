# Attempt following questions.                     #
# You can take help of your friends		   #
# But, if you do so, DO NOT COPY BLINDLY	   #

#### Lists
# Q-1. Create a list of any ten random numbers
# Q-2. From the list in Q-1:
	i)		Get its length
	ii)		Find its minimum element
	iii)	Find its maximum element
	iv)		Sum up all its elements
	v)		Extract first three elements from this list
	vi)		Extract elements from 3rd to 6th.
	vii)	Use list comprehension to extract 2nd and 5th elements
	viii)	Assign a value of 900 to elements 2nd and 5th using list
	     	comprehension
	ix)   Get index of any number from within the list
	 x)		Delete only the number at index 4
	xi)		Append following list in the above list, thus
	     	create a list of lists:
					[800, 78, 900, 20]
	xii)	Extend the existing list with above numbers


# Q-3 Add 8 to each element in the following list:
			[7,5,6,89]

# Q-4 Sort the following list in increasing order:
			[10,90,87, 5,900]

# Q-5 Sort the above list in decreasing order

# Q-6 Use the list in Q2, to create another list
      which contains every IInd element of the list.

# Q-7 In the list of Q2, start from 2nd element,
      and extract every IInd element upto 8th element.

#### Tuples

# Q-8 Transform the list of Q-2 into a tuple using function tuple()

# Q-9 On the tuple of Q8, perform the following:
					a. Try to assign value of 8 to 6th element
					b. Multiply every value in the tuple by 2
	   				 and create a list (Use list comprehension)

# Q-10 Create the following tuple:
			(2,10,5, 60,9,80)

			Multiply every element that is greater than 5 by 2 and create another list
			(hint: Use list comprehension.)

Q-11 Take the following two tuples:
			j = (2,3,4)
			k = (12,13,14)

		 Use zip() in list comprehension to multiply
     the two tuples-Ist element of one by Ist element of other
     IInd element of one by IInd element of other and so on..


#### Dictionary

Q-12 Create the following dictionary:

	d = { 'a' : 56, 'b' : 90, 'c' : 80 }

		a. Get a list of its keys
		b. Get a list of its values

Q-13 Create the following dictionary:
			d = { 'a' : [56,89,23], 'b' : 90, 'c' : 80 }

     Write a function to multiply all elements of the
     list associated with key 'a'.

Q-14 Write a lambda function to raise a number to the power of 8

Q-15 Write a lambda function to evaluate the following:
			x^9 + sqrt(x)    [hint: sqrt: x ** 0.5]
